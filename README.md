# ðŸ§¹ Clipboard Cleaner

A tiny cross-platform Python utility to wipe your clipboard.
Because your clipboard shouldnâ€™t become a security leak.

## Why?
Your clipboard is one of the most overlooked risks in day-to-day computing:
	- That API key you copied for testing? Still there.
 	- The production password you pasted into a config file? Still there.
  	- The credit card number you copied for an online payment? Still there.

One careless paste into Slack, email, or a terminal, and sensitive data can go places it was never meant to.

Clipboard Cleaner is a quick way to nuke your clipboard on demand â€” before it nukes you. Run it every morning before coffee!

## Usage

### Run directly
chmod +x clipboard_cleaner.py
python clipboard_cleaner.py
